# fetchNode <br />
  Utilizes APIs to get Results
 <br />

## Usage <br />
  **You need to have NodeJS installed for this to work** <br />
  Just redirect the directory to be the same as the folder it's in, then type 'node main.js' <br />

## Notes <br />
  **Use Powershell to Run the Script.** <br />
  **Or just run the start.bat file for ease of use I guess.** <br />
  <br />
  **Added Support to the nhentai api** <br />
