# fetchNode <br />
  Utilizes APIs to get Results
 <br />

## Usage <br />
  **You need to have NodeJS installed for this to work** <br />
  Just redirect the directory to be the same as the folder it's in, then type 'node main.js' <br />

## Notes <br />
  **Use Powershell to Run the Script.** <br />
  **Or just run the start.bat file for ease of use I guess.** <br />
  <br />
  **It now supports Multi-tagging. [ Depends on the site limits ]** <br />
  TODO : Source Function to Parse Image's Origin <br />
  TODO : Add a max image data size filter <br />
  TODO : Refactor Everything once the Script is finished <br />
  <br />
  ISSUE : Sites with the Booru api may serve some links behind a paywall, thus causing some pseudo-success downloads. <br />  

## Sites it can fetch <br />
> Danbooru <br />
> Gelbooru <br />
> rule34 <br />
> Paheal <br />
> nhentai <br />
 and etc ( too lazy to add them here ) <br />
